# Project 10 - CSS Accordeon with Pictures of Tbilisi

This is a css accordeon with some of beautiful photos of my hometown - Tbilisi, which is the capital of Georgia - or as we, Georgians call - Sakartvelo.

This is a small project and my first touch with css animations. Made fully responsive for all screen size devices. Hope you will enjoy it.
